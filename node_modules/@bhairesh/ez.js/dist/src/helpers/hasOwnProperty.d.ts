 * Determines whether an object has a property with the specified name.
 *
 * @param {object} obj - The object to check for properties.
 * @param {string} keys - The keys to check for in the object, separated by commas.
 * @param {boolean} [returnType=false] - Determines the return type of the function. Defaults to false.
 * @returns {string|boolean} - If returnType is true, returns a boolean value indicating whether all keys were found in the object. If returnType is false, returns a string indicating whether all keys were found or which keys were not found.
 *
 * @example
 * console.log(hasOwnProperty({'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}, "a,d"));
 * // Output: "d not found"
